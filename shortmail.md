# ShortMail

Tired of clunky webmail?

Now you can...

## Email like you text
Get a much faster view on your emails. 

## Respond immediately
Tap a name, enter your message and click 'Send'. That's it.

## And keep your current mail
Shortmail is an alternative interface to your email or webmail account. Messages you send are cc'ed to yourself, so your original interface still has a record.


 
## Subscribe
Privately tell us your email's popmail/imap address, and password. We'll set up your shortmail interface shortly.
