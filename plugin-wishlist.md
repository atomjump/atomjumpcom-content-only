# Plugin Wishlist


* A strikeout option - although this will likely be added to the core
* A large font theme for elderly people
* An accounting plugin that takes a series of free-text purchases added by staff (including 'repeat' purchases) and creates a spreadsheet ready for export to e.g. Xero.  Or even better - builds your tax and reports directly :)
* Warn when users come into forum
* Option to only see media, no text
* Options to see who is in group
* Viber-like stickers - any images you like at no cost (started)
* An admin panel for plugin/config
* Who is currently in the forum, or a forum count
* Android Chrome users popup notification
* Preventing problem users from posting (blacklisting)
* Voice clip recording
* Basic emoji, extended emoji, animated gifs
* Google Crawler - allow Google's crawler to search your messages
* Search facility, to search for messages by keyword within a group or within a company, or globally
* A forum new message count. Inputs: forum id, last msg id, logged user id. Returns current last msg id (used for next check), and count. Add this to livewiki and app interfaces for message count overview.
* A 'phone dialer' extension to the app, which optionally lets you dial / receive dialling from close colleagues, and takes you to the forum and / or the video option. 
* Hate message quarantine would email/message the forum owner with an 'Publish' 'Decline' option. To the user the msg would be either hidden or 'in quarantine'. Would need a PHP version (slower) and a NodeJS version which would extend the 'sentiment' script in the server, run once every 1 minute, for high speed servers. Keep in mind that any language could be used. Would suggest supporting top 10 popular languages worldwide. Keep the words to filter separated into a JSON config file which can be easily edited per installation.
