# Manifesto

AtomJump have switched it's messaging products to operate under a non-profit organization, the 'AtomJump Foundation'. Previously, the New Zealand based company AtomJump Ltd. owned and operated the software and service. AtomJump Ltd is one of the founding members and financial supporters of the AtomJump Foundation. The Foundation's purpose is to:

* Provide open source messaging tools, globally, that provide people with the ability to readily communicate using digital means.

The tools which the Foundation publishes will always be free, downloadable and 100% open source, and because of it's non-profit status, will aim to be commercially unbiased and without a profit motive. The organization can provide the option, but it will always be an option, to host it's tools for paying customers. Any income derived from this hosting goes directly back into the Foundation itself, supporting it's staff, systems, and other purchases deemed to be required to operate the Foundation.
