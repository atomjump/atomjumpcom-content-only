# Manifesto

AtomJump have switched it's messaging products to operate under a non-profit organization, the 'AtomJump Foundation'. Previously, the New Zealand based company AtomJump Ltd. owned and operated the software and service. AtomJump Ltd is one of the founding members and financial supporters of the AtomJump Foundation. The Foundation's purpose is to:

* Provide open source messaging tools, globally, that provide people with the ability to readily communicate using digital means.

The tools which the Foundation publishes will always be free, downloadable and 100% open source, and because of it's non-profit status, will aim to be commercially unbiased and without a profit motive. The organization can provide the option, but it will always be an option, to host it's tools for paying customers. Any income derived from this hosting goes directly back into the Foundation itself, supporting it's staff, systems, and other purchases deemed to be required to operate the Foundation.

The society votes are held in public at the road-map. https://roadmap.atomjump.com


# Rules


AtomJump Foundation Rules
Ver 0.0.4
8 August 2019


As per the New Zealand Section 6, Incorporated Societies Act 1908 rules, this document details how the AtomJump Foundation is organised.


__The name of the society (ending with the word Incorporated)__

AtomJump Foundation (Incorporated)


__The objects for which the society is established__

Provide open source messaging tools, globally, that provide people with the ability to readily communicate using digital means.

The tools which the Foundation publishes will always be free, downloadable and 100% open source, and because of it's non-profit status, will aim to be commercially unbiased and without a profit motive. The organization can provide the option, but it will always be an option, to host it's tools for paying customers. Any income derived from this hosting goes directly back into the Foundation itself, supporting it's staff, systems, and other purchases deemed to be required to operate the Foundation.
                                                  

__How people become members of the society and cease being members of the society__

Joining the society is much like being employed at our sister company AtomJump Ltd. An interview will take place if the person is not already known to the society, to establish that there is a fit with the organisation. Often, this interview will take the form of some voluntary project work within the open source AtomJump Messaging products, to establish an interest level and skill level.

Membership only implies that you actively contribute a vote, when a vote is presented to the whole society. It could potentially lead to a commercial relationship with the society through e.g. employment, but the employment salary will never be more than standard market rates within that category of work.

To quit membership, a member should simply let the Chair know that they can no longer commit time to the society, and that person will lose their voting rights. 

If a member is found to have acted against the principles of the society, a review panel will need to be formed to review whether to remove that member from the society. An appeal can be made to the Chair.


__How meetings of the society will be called and held and how voting will take place__

One annual general meeting will take place in April of each year. This will likely be held by digital video conferencing, if the members are too geographically distributed.

Any additional votes on direction will be sent to all members of the society via email / message group. If there is no majority (more than  50% of the vote), whoever is presenting will need to present a better case.


__How officers of the society will be appointed__

Appointment will be by a general society member’s majority vote (more than 50%).


__Control and use of the common seal__

Any member can make use of the common seal, although if a member is found to have mis-used this privilege, they may be removed from the organisation, on agreement from a review panel.


__How the society’s funds will be controlled and invested__

There will be one person appointed as treasurer, and 2-3 sub-treasurers. The treasurer has full access to the bank account of the organisation, and will make all payments, but the sub-treasurers can also access the account, if required, in an emergency.

All earnings will be re-invested into the operations and development of the Foundation. It will be up to all members to decide which developments/internal investments are highest priority, through their vote.


__The powers (if any) that the society has to borrow money__

The society, ideally, should never borrow money, however this is at the discretion of the treasurer. The servers and software have been set up to continue to run with very little financial means (simply one internet connection, and one existing hardware server).


How any property of the society will be distributed in the event of the society being wound up
The intellectual property in the software will return to AtomJump Ltd (New Zealand) if it still exists, and if not, the property will go to the original developer Peter Abrahamson, and his wife Hardip Abrahamson and their estate.


__How the rules of the society can be altered__

On a general majority vote (i.e. more than 50% of members must vote for the change).


__How does the society handle donations?__

Donation income is accepted, but it will only go towards infrastructure costs, and not towards staff income. [Pre]
