There are three main publicly visible sections to the AtomJump Foundation:

1. The atomjump.com public group hosted pages
2. The atomjump.com private group hosted pages
3. The atomjump.org software for use on your own servers

This vote is to do with section 1, the public groups.

__Background__

Originally, the public groups were intended as a way to post about and discuss a public topic live, in a more targeted way than other social media sites, such as Twitter. In Twitter you post globally, and if you choose to search for other similar topics (sometimes using a #topic hash tag), you can find other people's responses about that topic and respond to them globally.

However, AtomJump public groups are more like WhatsApp public groups, where anyone can post anything live about a particular topic, and a visible discussion takes place about that topic.

When we opened these forums up nobody was using the site, so to make our forums look more populated, and in an effort to spark conversation, we populated the forum with some on-topic live messages from Twitter.

__The problems__

- We don't have any real control over how these Twitter messages get filtered (other than our users choosing to delete them), which has potential ramifications, now that we can be fined for holding hate speech on our servers.

- The messages re-populate whenever someone new comes onto the page, interrupting any real flow to an existing conversation

__The proposed solution__

Quite simply, remove the Twitter feed, and let any existing Twitter messages be the last ones on those forums. In other words, AtomJump stands on it's own feet, from now on.

__Pros of this solution__

- It makes a forum more accessible for a discussion among new groups of people onto the site.
- We don't appear to be using Twitter as a crutch to kick start us.
- Almost all messages on atomjump.com are written by users of atomjump.com, which means we have the ability to filter them more easily, if necessary.

__Cons of this solution__

- People will often appear in a blank forum, and not realise what it could be used for.

This vote is for all members of the AtomJump Foundation, and you can discuss this prior to the vote on the CRM
