__Background__

The AtomJump Foundation has been set up to offer a non-profit, and open, alternative to today's social media companies. As such, almost everything that we do needs to be open to public scrutiny, from the software that we release, to the way that we communicate to the public.

__The Question__

Should we also make our Foundation's, currently internal, discussions open to the public?

__Potential Solution__

We could run our digital meetings for direction on an open discussion forum, using AtomJump software, and without password protection. E.g. https://roadmap.atomjump.com.

This would be open to the public, so any votes would also be able to be taken by non-members of the society, but there would be a public record of all decisions that we took.

There may still be a need for some private communications within the membership boundaries, e.g. around staff sicknesses etc.

Salaries for paid service roles may need to be listed publicly, although personal financial matters can still be kept private within the organisation's membership only.

__Pros of this solution__

- If we come under public scrutiny, we can point at our open discussions and demonstrate how we arrived at a solution. This has a great ability to diffuse tensions, and while it doesn't mean we are not accountable for what we release, it does give us a chance to work openly with other parties to come to a co-operative solution for a given problem.
- There is no need to enter passwords to get into discussions
- You have to take extra care when posting to the group, because you know it is in public.

__Cons of this solution__

- Some members may feel that they cannot express their opinions on a public group.
- External public parties could try to work to change the direction of a vote by convincing others to join the vote. Having said that, this is how democracy tends to work, anyway.

The deadline on this vote is 12 May 2019.

This vote is for all members of the AtomJump Foundation, and you can discuss this prior to the vote on the CRM
