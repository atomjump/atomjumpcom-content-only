**Background**
The AtomJump Foundation has been set up to offer a non-profit, and open, alternative to today's social media companies. As such, almost everything that we do needs to be open to public scrutiny, from the software that we release, to the way that we communicate to the public.

The Question
Should we make our Foundation's annual meetings open to the public? And if so, to what extent?

We have listed some possible options from most public to least, below.

Pros of being more public
Trust is a visual thing, and people matter. The way they conduct themselves makes a difference, and the public are much more likely to support an organisation if they can see who is behind it. If there is clearly nothing they have to hide, it makes doing business that much more straightforward.

We have to be careful that whatever we say is 'public-consumable', and this means keeping our meetings straightforward, positive and constructive, without criticizing others.

Cons of being more public
Our members may feel that they cannot express themselves during our meetings, for fear of their words being taken out-of-context, or their questions being too foolish. This is not the intention, but we do have to be careful that whatever we say is 'public-consumable', which can lead to hesitation amongst our members.

The deadline on this vote is Sat 31 May 2020  12pm NZST.

This vote is for all members of the AtomJump Foundation, and you can discuss this prior to the vote on the https://roadmap.atomjump.com open forum.
