Background
The AtomJump Foundation has been set up to offer a non-profit, and open, alternative to today's social media companies. While we appreciate people wanting to put a donation into the Foundation, care needs to be taken that this is not intended as an 'influencing' donation, and is indeed a genuine philanthropic donation.

The Question
Should we add a policy about donations as follows: that we accept donations but they must be non-refundable. All our donation income will only go towards infrastructure costs, and not towards staff income.

The reasoning
People may be tempted to give money to the Foundation in order to gain influence or 'power' over our staff or Foundation members. If they are giving consistent donations, and our organization and/or staff depend on this money for their livelihoods, they can threaten to withdraw those donations if they do not get their own way. Therefore, if we ensure that donations can only go towards infrastructure costs such as office space or equipment, we remove most of these opportunities for 'money influence'.

Pros of this solution
- Our staff remain isolated from money leveraging, and can keep an independent viewpoint. We only employ staff when there is enough income from our hosting earnings - which is hopefully widely shared among multiple paying customers.

Cons of this solution
- The organization may have short term needs for this income.
