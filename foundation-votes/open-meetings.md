# Background

The AtomJump Foundation has been set up to offer a non-profit, and open, alternative to today's social media companies. As such, almost everything that we do needs to be open to public scrutiny, from the software that we release, to the way that we communicate to the public.

# The Question

Should we make our Foundation's annual meetings open to the public? And if so, to what extent?

# Possible Options

In order of most public to least:

* We hold live public visual meetings
* We record the meetings visually, and make those public once any visual issues are fixed
* We hold live audio meetings (similar to a 'Shareholders' call in public companies)
* We record the audio of the meetings, and make those public
* We record the meetings, and release minutes of the meetings
* We release a public summary of the meetings
* We do not release any details of our annual meetings
