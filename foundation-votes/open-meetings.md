# Background

The AtomJump Foundation has been set up to offer a non-profit, and open, alternative to today's social media companies. As such, almost everything that we do needs to be open to public scrutiny, from the software that we release, to the way that we communicate to the public.

# The Question

Should we make our Foundation's annual meetings open to the public? And if so, to what extent?

# Possible Options

In order of most public to least:

* We hold live public visual meetings
* We record the meetings visually, and make those public once any visual issues are fixed
* We hold live audio meetings (similar to a 'Shareholders' call in public companies)
* We record the audio of the meetings, and make those public
* We record the meetings, and release minutes of the meetings
* We release a public summary of the meetings
* We do not release any details of our annual meetings

We did not warn any members of the possibility of our last video meeting being made public prior to the event (and actually the idea only came afterwards). Would you give consent for: 

* The technical sections to be released
* All content to be released

# Pros of being more public

Trust is a visual thing, and people matter. The way they conduct themselves makes a difference, and the public are much more likely to support an organisation if they can see who is behind it. 

If there is clearly nothing they have to hide, it makes doing business that much more straightforward.
We have to be careful that whatever we say is 'public-consumable', and this means keeping our meetings straightforward, positive and constructive, without criticizing others.

# Cons of being more public

Our members may feel that they cannot express themselves during our meetings, for fear of their words being taken out-of-context, or their questions being too foolish. This is not the intention, but we do have to be careful that whatever we say is 'public-consumable', which can lead to hesitation amongst our members.
