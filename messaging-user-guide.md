# Messaging User Guide


## Introduction
AtomJump Messaging is a multi-layered 'Progressive Web App', for live messaging and forum communication. It's core is a messaging interface that operates a single forum, and this guide will teach you how to operate this interface. You can find AtomJump forums by clicking on a link on a website, which opens the forum in a pop-up box within your browser. There are lots of different types of websites that can operate these forums, and AtomJump.com is one of these websites, which is hosted by the AtomJump Foundation. 

There is also an optional starter app (which is also a 'Progressive Web App'), which allows you to collect your favourite forums in one place and check for new messages from any AtomJump Messaging forum across the internet. All of these components are open source and free.

Being a Progressive Web App, there are certain advantages over dedicated apps:

* You can be discussing something on your phone and switch across to a desktop version of the same conversation, immediately, potentially without even logging in.
* You can invite a group of people to a forum, who haven’t signed in to AtomJump before, simply by sending a web link. They don’t have to create an account.
* For a new person to join the conversation, there is no unwieldy download of a large app, with lots of security requests on the phone.
* Each different forum can be operated by a different organisation, and the functionality of that forum is chosen by the operator, being put together out of basic building blocks (called ‘plugins’).

To get started you can try a forum on e.g. https://atomjump.com

To get the optional AtomJump Messaging starter app (iPhone/Android/Desktop): 

* https://app.atomjump.com

## Post a Message
If you’re on AtomJump.com click on the large blue ‘chat’ button to enter a forum. Other sites using AtomJump software will show the messaging pop-up after you click a particular link.

Start typing in the ‘Enter your comment’ box at the top and click ‘send’. That’s it! You don’t need an account, although you will be called ‘Anon XX’ if you haven’t named yourself.


## To Compose a Message
You can enter some common messaging shortcuts for various types of media.

** This feature is on by default at AtomJump.com, but it may not be if your provider has not included these plugins.

## To Video Conference

When you’re in a forum, click on the camera icon next to the ‘Send’ button. This will provide a confirmation screen before entering the video forum. Some browsers need the camera to be accepted in your browser permissions first.

<img src="http://atomjump.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/video-cam.png">

iPhone and iPad users will need to download a separate app.

* https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/jitsi-meet/id1165103905
* https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.jitsi.meet
* https://jitsi.org/downloads/

To meet someone, you are best to send other people a URL of the AtomJump forum (on AtomJump.com you can click the share icon) and tell them to click on the camera. You’ll find more instructions at Jitsi. https://jitsi.org/user-faq/

Note: These video forums are public, unless you are on a private forum, and while you must accept new users before they join, after this you should be cautious with what you show other people. If you want privacy here, you should start a one-off session, or purchase a private forum.

Alternative Method: While you should be able to click through to the video forum on most platforms, some platforms e.g. particularly iPads / Internet Explorer, you can alternatively run the desktop / app directly, and enter the forum name. For AtomJump.com pages the forum name will be ‘aj-[a unique code]-ajps_’ followed by the subdomain. You can also find this by looking at the address of the video link, after the last ‘/’.


## To Name Yourself
Click ‘Settings’ in the bottom left corner. Write your name into ‘Your Name’ and click ‘Save Settings’. You don’t need a full account, but if you want to receive notifications when you get a private message, you will need one (see below).

<img src="http://atomjump.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/your-name.png">


## To Set up an Account

Setting up an account means you can receive private messages. Click ‘Settings’ in the bottom left corner. Write your name into ‘Your Name’, and your email address into ‘Your email’.

Optionally, you can add a password on the account (which prevents someone else being able to read your private messages). If you want to add this, and it is highly recommended, click ‘More’ and enter your password.

Click ‘Save Settings’.

<img src="http://atomjump.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/settings.png">

You will get e-mail notifications on private messages, but we do not use your email address for any other purpose.

## To Log in on a new PC or phone
Use the same email and password that you entered on your first device when you set up the account.

Remember, if you are on a public PC, you should log out whenever you leave the PC, as your login details will be remembered.

Note: each different AtomJump Server installation has it's own private users database. If your account was set up on AtomJump.com, then the account may be shared across other AtomJump.com properties, but, it will not necessarily work in every version of the messaging popup that you might find, because these are run by other companies.

## To Write a Private Message to One Person
Click or tap on the person’s name next to one of their messages. Then enter a message and tap ‘Send to [their name]’.

<img src="http://atomjump.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/send-privately-288x300.png">

You will need to click ‘Go Public’ to start posting messages for everyone to see again.

## To Write a Private Message to the Forum Subscribers(s)
Click ‘Go Private’. Enter messages as normal.

Once you are ready to return to posting to the public forum, click ‘Go Public’ again.

## To Reply to a Twitter User
Click or tap on the person’s name next to one of their messages. Then enter a message and tap ‘Send’.

Note, a Twitter reply will always be public, and you do not need a Twitter account. A message will automatically be sent from our AtomJump account saying that there is a message waiting for them on the forum you are currently on. It is up to them as to whether they will read their Twitter messages and respond.

## To Become a Forum Subscriber

If you <b><i>don’t have an account</i></b>, and only want to receive emailed notifications (without having to sign in), you can subscribe by tapping and switching the ear to the green ‘listening ear’ in the messaging window, which will ask for your email address. Then click ‘Subscribe’.

* <img src="http://atomjump.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/not-listening.png">
<i>Not subscribed. Tap to subscribe.</i>

* <img src="http://atomjump.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/listening.png">
<i>Subscribed. Tap to unsubscribe.</i>

If you <b><i>do have an account</i></b>, you should log in first. To do this, click into ‘Settings’, click ‘More’ for the password box, and enter your email and password. Then click ‘Login’.

Now in the messaging page, tap and switch the ear to the green ‘listening ear’ to subscribe to that one forum.

To <b>unsubscribe</b> from a subscribed forum, tap and switch to the red ‘non-listening ear’ on the messaging page.

## To Set up a Group

Enter your own group name, or an existing public group name, where it says “Enter a group name” on AtomJump.com, and click <span class="notranslate">“AtomJump”</span>.

<img src="http://atomjump.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/group-name-290x300.png">

e.g. Entering <span class="notranslate">“sailinglondon”</span> and tapping <span class="notranslate">“AtomJump”</span> will take your browser to the following address:

<img src="http://atomjump.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/sailinglondon.png">

Share your forum’s web link, with your group via email, SMS, instant message, or some other means. You can find this link quickly on atomjump.com by tapping the ‘share’ icon in the top right hand corner of the underlying page.

<img src="http://atomjump.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/share-300x192.png">

Each individual can then choose to become a forum subscriber to get ongoing notifications.

<b>Advanced Tip:</b> you can optionally add <span class="notranslate">“/go/”</span> to the end of your web link, which will open up the live forum for your guests immediately (so that they don’t have to tap the large blue ‘go’ button).

<b>Temporary Addresses</b>

If you were sent to a temporary address (e.g. http://sailinglondon.clst4.atomjump.com), and told it would be 2-48 hours to be fully active, you can check on the status of the domain transfer at https://dnschecker.org. Enter your page's intended address e.g. "sailinglondon.atomjump.com" and search.  What you need to confirm is that all addresses returned are different to "114.23.93.129" (which is the existing atomjump.com home address). Once this is the case, everyone can see the correct server and you are safe to invite other people to the forum.  If not, there is a chance that some users will write onto the message forum, but those messages will be sent to the wrong server, and will not be visible to other users.

## To Set up a Private Room

On AtomJump․com, you can enter your own unique room name where it says <span class="notranslate">“Enter a group name”</span>, e.g. <span class="notranslate">“fredfamily”</span>, and tap the bottom entry <span class="notranslate">‘Create a PRIVATE room’</span>.

<img src="http://atomjump.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/fredfamily-208x300.png">

On AtomJump․com, this costs NZ$ 15 / year (approx $US 10 / year). You can also sign up directly on <a href="http://atomjump.org/wp/introduction/">this page</a>. On other sites, you should contact your system administrator to add a private forum password.

Note: the forum password you decide to have is different from your personal password and should be one that you can email to every member of the room comfortably.

## To Get SMS Notifications
Note, on AtomJump.com this has been superseded by the app, which is free, and provides graphical message popups. These instructions may still apply to other installations of the server, however.

Click ‘Settings’ in the bottom left corner. Click ‘More’, and enter your international phone number without the leading plus sign ‘+’ and without spaces, e.g. ‘+64 3 384 5613’ should be entered as ‘6433845613’.

<img src="http://atomjump.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/sms-phone.png">

There will likely be a cost from your provider (e.g. 16c per message), so please check the instructions from your provider.

## To Get App Notifications

App Notifications, while possible, are not very noticeable on AtomJump Messaging. Generally, the people behind AtomJump prefer a quiet life, so you are best to treat your message notifications more like you treat email: you check for new messages when you want to check for them, not when everyone else wants you to check for them. In other words, you are in control of your space and you respect other people's general wish for silence from your phone.

Go to the web address of the forum. Click ‘Settings’ and enter your email and password.

<img src="http://atomjump.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/settings.png">

There are some links to ‘Get popup notifications’ for Android and iOS. Click and open the app on your Android or iPhone device. If this is on a private server, you will need to copy the server address mentioned, also.

Open the app.

<img src="http://atomjump.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/messaging-pair-3.jpg">

Within the app, tap the <span class="notranslate">‘Pair with AtomJump.com’</span> button, or for a private server, tap the <span class="notranslate">‘Pair with a Private Server’</span> button and paste in your private server address.

If everything has worked correctly, the app should say <span class="notranslate">‘Listening for Messages’</span>, and the browser should show that you have associated your app with your email address.

<img src="http://atomjump.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/messaging-pair-2-2.jpg">

This means any personal messages for this account will pop up when the app is open, and on some devices (i.e. desktop/Android) will make a ping sound on your phone if the app is running in a background tab. However, on many Android phones, the ping sound will not be heard if the phone has gone into sleep mode. 

Tap this tab for a full version of the message, and then tap on <span class="notranslate">‘Open Forum’</span> to enter the forum itself, which allows you to respond.

To <b>stop message notifications</b> at any time you can log out of the app. Message notifications will be made by email while you are logged out. Logging back in will start notifications again.

You can subscribe to any number of forums. See <a href="#become-owner">‘To Become a Forum Subscriber’</a> above.


<b>Troubleshooting</b>

* If you aren't getting notifications on an __Android__ phone, using the 'AtomJump'-style messages  until you open the app, your app may be set to sleep in the background. This can happen on Samsung phones, in particular and may not be possible to change. You may be able to add the 'AtomJump Messaging' app to your list of 'never sleeping' apps. See <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/05/30/how-to-prevent-apps-sleeping-in-the-background-on-android/">more details</a> here.

## To Save a Forum Shortcut
If you are on your phone, we would recommend installing the AtomJump Messaging app.

* https://app.atomjump.com

Tap "Register on an AtomJump group or a Private Server" and enter the group name of your xyz.atomjump.com page (for xyz.atomjump.com you would type ‘xyz’), or paste in the URL mentioned on your private forum, under 'Settings'.


## To Post a Photo
Click on the ‘upload’ icon in the bottom left corner. Select a .jpg photo from your drive and click ‘Upload’. Note: you can choose more than one photo.

<img src="http://atomjump.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/upload.png">

Note: if you are using a mobile device e.g. Android, to get access to your Gallery rather than the ‘Camera’, select ‘Documents’ and then ‘Gallery’.

You can choose to see a zoom-able preview of the photo by tapping the thumbnail previews that appear. Tap the photo again to close the full preview.

## To Post a Sticker **
Click the smiley face in the bottom left corner. Then click your sticker.

<img src="http://atomjump.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/laugh1-150x150.jpg">

## To Download Messages
Log in with your account. Click the ‘Upload’ icon in the bottom left corner. Click the ‘Download’ button. It will download an .xlsx spreadsheet file, which can be opened by any spreadsheet software e.g. Open Office, Google Docs, Microsoft Office.

## To Change Language **
Click ‘Settings’ in the bottom left corner. Then click ‘More’ and drop down the ‘Language’ box. Choose your language. Then click ‘Save Settings’. You may need to enter your password again if you are logged in.

Note: the front grey box with the icon 'Settings' will only change language if the surrounding site has implemented this feature, and you may need to refresh the page in your browser. Changing language will change the 'guide' messages in the central box. It does not affect the text entered by other users.

## To Go Full-Screen **

On your **Android phone**, when you are on a frequented AtomJump messaging page go into 'settings' for the browser (often a 3 bar icon near the address at the top), and select the option 'Add to Home screen', or something similar.

On your **iPhone**, when you are on a frequented AtomJump messaging page tap the 'share' icon at the bottom of the page, and then the 'Add to Home screen' icon at the bottom, or something similar.

Then go back to your phone's home screen and tap the icon. This will then use the full screen real-estate during messaging.

## To Delete Messages

Anyone can delete any message on AtomJump.com, and we allow this so that forums are largely self moderating. While it may mean that your message is unfairly deleted by someone, it does mean that only the messages that everyone approves of will stay on the forum. If you have issues that cannot be resolved with this policy, please contact us on the Privacy page.

To delete a message, tap or click on the message itself, and you will be shown the message with a rubbish bin icon underneath. Tap the rubbish bin icon, and the message should be removed in a few seconds.

<img src="http://atomjump.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/delete-example-150x150.png">

Note: After a message has been posted you have 20 minutes (for a default installation of AtomJump, and that includes AtomJump.com) to delete the message before other robot feeds have a chance to copy the message.

## To Stop Flickering Images on Android

On an Android phone, if you are connecting to a non-secure ‘http’ Messaging server, and your phone browser’s setting’s ‘Lite Mode’ is switched on, you will likely find images seem to flicker every 5 seconds or so. We would recommend switching ‘Lite Mode’ off to stop the flickering in your phone’s Chrome Browser Settings page.

Alternatively, if an ‘https’ domain is associated with the server, the problem should disappear.
