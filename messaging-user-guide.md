# Messaging User Guide


## Post a Message
If you’re on AtomJump.com click on the large blue ‘chat’ button to enter a forum. Other sites using AtomJump software will show the messaging pop-up after you click a particular link.

Start typing in the ‘Enter your comment’ box at the top and click ‘send’. That’s it! You don’t need an account, although you will be called ‘Anon XX’ if you haven’t named yourself.


## To Compose a Message
You can enter some common messaging shortcuts for various types of media.

** This feature is on by default at AtomJump.com, but it may not be if your provider has not included these plugins.

## To Video Conference
When you’re in a forum, click on the camera icon next to the ‘Send’ button. This will provide a confirmation screen before entering the video forum. Some browsers need the camera to be accepted in your browser permissions first.

iPhone and iPad users will need to download a separate app.

https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/jitsi-meet/id1165103905
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.jitsi.meet
https://jitsi.org/downloads/

To meet someone, you are best to send other people a URL of the AtomJump forum (on AtomJump.com you can click the share icon) and tell them to click on the camera. You’ll find more instructions at Jitsi. https://jitsi.org/user-faq/

Note: These video forums are public, and while you must accept new users before they join, after this you should be cautious with what you show other people. If you want privacy here, you should choose an obscure forum name.

Alternative Method: While you should be able to click through to the video forum on most platforms, some platforms e.g. particularly iPads / Internet Explorer, you can alternatively run the desktop / app directly, and enter the forum name. For AtomJump.com pages the forum name will be ‘aj-ajps_’ followed by the subdomain. You can also find this by looking at the address of the video link, after the last ‘/’.

## To Name Yourself
Click ‘Settings’ in the bottom left corner. Write your name into ‘Your Name’ and click ‘Save Settings’. You don’t need a full account, but if you want to receive notifications when you get a private message, you will need one (see below).



## To Set up an Account
Setting up an account means you can receive private messages. Click ‘Settings’ in the bottom left corner. Write your name into ‘Your Name’, and your email address into ‘Your email’.

Optionally, you can add a password on the account (which prevents someone else being able to read your private messages). If you want to add this, and it is highly recommended, click ‘More’ and enter your password.

Click ‘Save Settings’.



You will get e-mail notifications on private messages, but we do not use your email address for any other purpose.

## To Log in on a new PC or phone
Use the same email and password that you entered on your first device when you set up the account.

Remember, if you are on a public PC, you should log out whenever you leave the PC, as your login details will be remembered.

Note: each different AtomJump Server installation has it’s own private users database. If your account was set up on AtomJump.com, then the account will be consistent across all atomjump.com properties, but, it will not necessarily work in every version of the messaging popup that you might find, because these are run by other companies.

## To Write a Private Message to One Person
Click or tap on the person’s name next to one of their messages. Then enter a message and tap ‘Send to [their name]’.



You will need to click ‘Go Public’ to start posting messages for everyone to see again.

## To Write a Private Message to the Forum Subscribers(s)
Click ‘Go Private’. Enter messages as normal.

Once you are ready to return to posting to the public forum, click ‘Go Public’ again.

## To Reply to a Twitter User
Click or tap on the person’s name next to one of their messages. Then enter a message and tap ‘Send’.

Note, a Twitter reply will always be public, and you do not need a Twitter account. A message will automatically be sent from our AtomJump account saying that there is a message waiting for them on the forum you are currently on. It is up to them as to whether they will read their Twitter messages and respond.

## To Become a Forum Subscriber
If you don’t yet have an account, or you don’t want one immediately, you can do this by clicking the red ‘crossed out’ ear icon, or clicking ‘Settings’, and entering your email address in the ‘Email’ field. Then click ‘Subscribe’.

If you do have an account, you should log in first (with your email and password). Click ‘More’ for the password box, enter your password, click ‘Login’, and then in the ‘Settings’ page click ‘subscribe’, or on the messaging page, click the red ‘crossed out’ ear icon.

To unsubscribe from a subscribed forum, click ‘Settings’ and then ‘unsubscribe’ (after you are logged in), or click the green ‘ear’ icon on the messaging page.

## To Set up a Group
Share the web address of your forum with your group. You can find this quickly on atomjump.org by tapping the ‘share’ icon in the top right hand corner. Each individual can then choose to become a forum subscriber to get ongoing notifications.

## To Set up a Private Group
On atomjump.org, you can enter a group name, and tap the bottom entry ‘Create a private group’. This will automatically fill in an email for us. Please replace the group password before sending the email. On atomjump.org, this costs $US 10 / year, and you can sign up on this page. On other forums, you should contact your system administrator to add a forum password.

Note: this forum password is different from your personal password and should be one that you can email to every member of the group comfortably.

## To Get SMS Notifications
Note, on AtomJump.com this has been superseded by the app, which is free, and provides graphical message popups. These instructions may still apply to other installations of the server, however.

Click ‘Settings’ in the bottom left corner. Click ‘More’, and enter your international phone number without the leading plus sign ‘+’ and without spaces, e.g. ‘+64 3 384 5613’ should be entered as ‘6433845613’.



The cost is 16c per message. We bill on a monthly basis.

## To Get App Notifications
Enter your email and password in ‘Settings’. Click ‘More’. There are some links to ‘Get popup notifications’ for Android and iOS. Click and download the app to your Android or iPhone device. If this is on a private server, you will need to copy the server address mentioned, also.

Tap the app link within Settings once more, and tap ‘open the app’ within the app-store. Within the app, tap the ‘Pair AtomJump.com’ button, or paste in your private server and tap the ‘Private Server Pairing’ button. If everything has worked correctly, the app should say ‘Listening for Messages’, and the browser should show that you have associated your app with your email address. This means any private messages will pop up.

Note: you can only be logged in on one device at a time.

To stop message notifications at any time you can log out of the app. Message notifications will be made by email while you are logged out. Logging back in will start notifications again.

You can subscribe to any number of forums. See ‘To Become a Forum Subscriber’ above.

## To Post a Photo
Click on the ‘upload’ icon in the bottom left corner. Select a .jpg photo from your drive and click ‘Upload’. Note: you can choose more than one photo.

Note: if you are using a mobile device e.g. Android, to get access to your Gallery rather than the ‘Camera’, select ‘Documents’ and then ‘Gallery’.

Note: photos are best uploaded as landscape photos.

You can choose to see a zoom-able preview of the photo by tapping the thumbnail previews that appear. Tap the photo again to close the full preview.

## To Post a Sticker **
Click the smiley face in the bottom left corner. Then click your sticker.



## To Download Messages
Log in with your account. Click the ‘Upload’ icon in the bottom left corner. Click the ‘Download’ button. It will download an .xlsx spreadsheet file, which can be opened by any spreadsheet software e.g. Open Office, Google Docs, Microsoft Office.

## To Change Language **
Click ‘Settings’ in the bottom left corner. Then click ‘More’ and drop down the ‘Language’ box. Choose your language. Then click ‘Save Settings’. You may need to enter your password again if you are logged in.

Note: the front grey box with the word ‘Settings’ will only change language if the surrounding site has implemented this feature. Changing language will change the ‘guide’ messages in the central box. It does not affect the text entered by other users.

## To Go Full-Screen **

On your **Android phone**, when you are on a frequented AtomJump messaging page go into 'settings' for the browser (often a 3 bar icon near the address at the top), and select the option 'Add to Home screen', or something similar.

On your **iPhone**, when you are on a frequented AtomJump messaging page tap the 'share' icon at the bottom of the page, and then the 'Add to Home screen' icon at the bottom, or something similar.

Then go back to your phone's home screen and tap the icon. This will then use the full screen real-estate during messaging.

## To Delete Messages

Anyone can delete any message on AtomJump.com, and we allow this so that forums are largely self moderating. While it may mean that your message is unfairly deleted by someone, it does mean that only the messages that everyone approves of will stay on the forum. If you have issues that cannot be resolved with this policy, please contact us on the Privacy page.

To delete a message, tap or click on the message itself, and you will be shown the message with a rubbish bin icon underneath. Tap the rubbish bin icon, and the message should be removed in a few seconds.

Note: After a message has been posted you have 20 minutes (for a default installation of AtomJump, and that includes AtomJump.com) to delete the message before other robot feeds have a chance to copy the message.

## To Stop Flickering Images on Android

On an Android phone, if you are connecting to a non-secure ‘http’ Messaging server, and your phone browser’s setting’s ‘Lite Mode’ is switched on, you will likely find images seem to flicker every 5 seconds or so. We would recommend switching ‘Lite Mode’ off to stop the flickering in your phone’s Chrome Browser Settings page.

Alternatively, if an ‘https’ domain is associated with the server, the problem should disappear.
